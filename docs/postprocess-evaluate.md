# Postprocess + per-lesion evaluation

Two CLIs that turn a finished segmentation run directory into a postprocessed
prediction set and a per-3D-lesion detection score, with an interactive 3D
Plotly HTML per case.

## When to run this

Run after `mri.cli.diagnose` (or after a fresh training run) when you want to
answer:

- "Did the model find each lesion that was actually there?"
- "Is the model staying quiet on healthy cases?"

The voxel-level Dice / precision / recall in the diagnostic report don't
answer either of those questions on their own.

## Pipeline

```
mri.cli.diagnose  →  mri.cli.postprocess  →  mri.cli.evaluate
```

`postprocess` will auto-run the dump step (the same one diagnose uses) if
the prediction cache is missing, so in practice you can skip diagnose if you
only care about the postprocessed evaluation.

## Step 1 — Postprocess

```bash
uv run python -m mri.cli.postprocess <run_dir>
```

Applies two voxel-wise rules:

1. **Target outside prostate is ignored** — `lesion_mask &= gland_mask`.
2. **No prostate ⇒ no target** — when no gland voxel passes its threshold,
   the lesion mask is fully zeroed.

Both use the *predicted* gland (not GT), so the rules mirror what would
happen at deployment.

Output: `<run_dir>/diagnostic/postprocessed/<case>/{lesion_mask.npz, gland_mask.npz, meta.json}`.

Useful flags:

- `--lesion-threshold 0.4 --gland-threshold 0.3` — override the thresholds
  (default: `metrics.segmentation_threshold` from the resolved config).
- `--force` — regenerate `postprocessed/` even if it already exists (re-run
  postprocessing under different thresholds without re-running inference).

## Step 2 — Evaluate

```bash
uv run python -m mri.cli.evaluate <run_dir>
```

For each case:

- **Positive case (≥ 1 GT lesion).** GT is split into 3D-connected
  components. Each component is scored by the *max* IoU across the slices
  it spans; a component is detected iff that max IoU > `--correctness-iou`
  (default 0.1). Detection is per-lesion, not per-case: a 2-lesion case
  with one hit and one miss contributes 1/2 to lesion-level recall.
- **Negative case (no GT lesion).** Correct iff the postprocessed
  prediction covers ≤ `--negative-area-frac` (default 0.02 = 2%) of *every*
  slice.

Outputs under `<run_dir>/diagnostic/evaluation/`:

- `metrics_by_lesion.csv` — one row per 3D GT lesion in the cohort.
- `metrics_by_case.csv` — one row per case (positive or negative).
- `summary.json` — cohort lesion-recall, negative-case accuracy, and the
  parameters used.
- `visuals/<case>.html` — interactive 3D Plotly figure per case (toggleable
  per-component, color-coded by detection verdict).
- `visuals/index.html` — gallery linking to all per-case HTMLs.

Useful flags:

- `--correctness-iou 0.2` — tighten the detection bar.
- `--negative-area-frac 0.01` — tighten the false-alarm bar.
- `--connectivity 26` — 26-connectivity in 3D for GT CC labeling
  (default 6).
- `--visualize-only failed` — only render HTMLs for cases with any missed
  lesion or any negative-case false alarm. Use `none` to skip rendering
  entirely.
- `--downsample-vis 2` — downsample voxel grids 2x along each axis before
  isosurface extraction; cuts HTML size for large volumes.
- `--plotly-cdn` — load Plotly from CDN instead of inlining ~3 MB per HTML.
